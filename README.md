## Overview
Intro section with dropdown navigation solution 

- This challenge is to test my ability to create dropdown navigation menus, a common pattern on larger sites. It will aslso provide some nice basic layout challenges and responsiveness.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- @media query
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla javascript

### What I learned

 - Using the mobile-first workflow for designing and responsiveness
 - Creating a dropdown using pure css and vanilla javasript
 - Positioning HTML elements using css flexbox
 - I also learned more about visual studio code

somes code am proud of

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: none;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start;
  background-color: #fff;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 60%;
  padding-top: 50px;
  height: max-content;
  padding-top: 100px;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
const funcNav = (choice) => {
    if (choice == openNav) {
        navsbar.style.display = 'block'
        closeNav.style.display = 'block'
    }
    else if(choice == closeNav) {
        navsbar.style.display = 'none'
        openNav.style.display = 'block'
    }
}
}
```
